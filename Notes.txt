value = possible setting for a property. oclor can be red, black, blue...
  Basic style properties:
    background-color
    border
    font-weight
    font-family
    color
    text-align
  modify css in webpage, then transfer to css file in TE
  keep css separate from html and javascript

  ID: #
  Class: .
Examples
  p{color:red;} - select all paragraphs
  p#red-one{color:red;} select paragraph with id red-one
  p.callout{color:red;} select all paragraphs with class callout
  .callout{color:red;} select all elements with class callout
  div.callout p{color: red;} select the div with class callout, within that select the paragraphs
  p.special{color:red;} 
  p{color:black;}


  **css - more specificity takes precedence over less specificity
  Nested Html tags inherit the properties of their parents
  p - tag name
  { - open bracket
  color: - property
  red - value
  } - close bracket

  Selectors - 
    Tag Names, 
    ID names(# + ID) or (Element + # + ID), 
    Class Names (. + Class) or (Element + . + Class), 
    Inside An Element(Element + Space + Element),
    More Than One(Element + , + Element),
    Children(Element + > + Element), - Selects immediate children of an element

  More Magic
    div.special {
      margin: 10px;}   Select any div with class name .special
    div .special{
      margin: 10px;}   Select any class .special within div
    div,.special{
      margin: 10px;}   Select all div and all class .special
    .special div{
      margin: 10px;}   Select any div within any element with class .special

  CSS Style Guide
      Everything below selector is indented
      One space after all punctuation

      Rule 1: Selectors on one line
      Rule 2: use whitespace
      Rule 3: Put each attriubte and value on its own line
      Rule 4: Curly brackets follow the selector and are on a  new line after the last rule
      Rule 5: We indent everything within curly brackets
      Rule 6: Add a space after all punctuation
      Rule 7: lowercase at all times except font names
      Rule 8: Units follow their number with no spaces
      Rule 9: Insert comments to help you maintain your code

CSS Pseudo Classes
      :hover
      :first-child
      :focus
      :not(selector)
      (There are a lot of them)

4/18/2024  - File Structrue and Pseudocode
True file structure is very important
Folders and files are organized hierarchically
What is a file? - An ordinary file contains data
    lab.css
    bio-pic.jpg
    index.html
What is a folder? - A collection of files
    css
    img
    js
What is a directory?

Creating File Structure
    To create a new file in Atom, right click on the project folder where you want your new file. Select new file and give it a name with a file extension, like index.html
    To create a new folder in ATom, right click on the project folder wheere you want your new folder. Select new folder and give it a name, like css
    You can also rename files and oflder, move them, and copy them within an Atom project. We can also do this in finder or file explorer. (Be careful not to do this unintentionally)
    The more organized your file structure is, the easier your job will be and the better web developer you will be.

File Hierarchy
    Folders and files can have "parents", "children", "siblings", and a "roots"
    A parent folder is the folder that contains a particular file or folder.
    A child file or folder is the one contained within a parent folder.
    Siblings are files or folders in the same folder.
    When we want to reference a file that is a sibling, we can just use the filename:
        <img src = "hello.jpg">

Ways to link files
    We can use an anchor tag <a> to link to files
    We can use the image tag <img> to link to image files
    We can use the link tag <link> to link files

example directory
    .art101 
        index.html       - How to Link -->       <img src = "./img/dog.jpg">     <link href ="./css/site.css">       <a href = "./lab3/index.html">
        css
            site.css            
        lab3
            index.html  - How to Link -->        <link href = "./css/lab.css">      <img src = "./img/cat.jpg">  /  <a href = "../index.httml">       <link href = "../css/site.css">     <img src = "../img/dog.jpg">
            css 
                lab.css
            img
                cat.jpg
        img
            dog.jpg

    Relative links apply to the html file you are working on (see example above)

Naming Conventions
    What do you notice about all the file and folder names?
        We use all lowercase
        We use dashes instead of spaces

Local vs. Server
    When we say local, we mean files on the computer
    When we say server, we mean files available from a computer somewhere on the internet
    If we want our files to be seen on the internet, then upload
Remember
    Test and debug locally
    make changes, hit reload.
    upload only after our files are working

File transfer protocol
    To upload files, we use an internet standard called "file transfer protocol", (though these days we use SFTP, a secure version of FTP)
    We use special sftp software to upload our file structure to the server
    Cyberduck and Filezilla are popular
    in our case, we are using github desktop which does the file transfer to our git repo behind the scenes
    Once we put push our commits, we are all set.
