					<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p id = "bio">	
							As a 4th-year AGPM major, my academic journey has been a blend of analytical thinking and creative exploration. The skills I've honed in this program have not only expanded my understanding of game design and project management but have also fostered a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology and artistry. Through courses that challenge me to think critically and innovate, I've cultivated a mindset that thrives on problem-solving and pushing boundaries in the gaming industry. The theoretical knowledge I've gained complements my practical experiences in crafting games and testing their mechanics, providing me with a well-rounded perspective on the gaming landscape.

							In my spare time, immersing myself in the world of video games allows me to not only unwind but also stay abreast of the latest trends and technologies shaping the industry. Whether I'm exploring new releases, analyzing game mechanics, or participating in beta testing, my passion for gaming fuels my creativity and keeps me engaged with evolving narratives and gameplay styles. This hands-on approach to gaming extends beyond mere entertainment; it serves as a source of inspiration for my own game development projects, where I can apply innovative ideas and techniques gleaned from my gaming experiences.

							The realm of music holds a special place in my heart, with my ability to play five instruments serving as a testament to my dedication and love for musical expression. From the melodic strumming of a guitar to the emotive keystrokes of a piano, each instrument offers a unique channel for me to convey thoughts and emotions through music. This creative outlet not only provides me with a means of self-expression but also serves as a source of relaxation and personal growth. Whether I'm composing original pieces, learning new songs, or jamming with friends, music remains a constant companion in my journey of self-discovery and artistic exploration.
