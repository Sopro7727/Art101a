			<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some issues regarding condensing my code into a cleaner and more concise version. I accomplished this through using a switchcase rather than an if statement, and I think it looks a little better now.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was interesting. I think I rewrote the conditional 4 times, each time using a different strategy before I settled on the one I wanted to use. This was really time consuming, and it kinda made my head hurt. </p>
