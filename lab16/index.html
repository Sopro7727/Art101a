			<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some issues getting rid of the CORS error that came with using the JSON, but I eventually just switched over to chrome.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a fun final challenge for the quarter. It was plenty difficult, and it was worth putting together. The comics aren't necessarily funny, but it's cool to see all my hard work in action. </p>
