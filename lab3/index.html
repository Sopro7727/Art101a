			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem I ran into with this lab was I couldn't think of things to write about myself. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went fairly well. I did kind of rush through it however, since I got a new kitten the day I started to do this lab. </p>
			</div>
