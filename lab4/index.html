			<h1>Lab 4- Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create some functional pseudocode for an everyday task and a simple computer game</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had to look up the syntax for a javascript multiline comment, but that was about it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a little out of the box for how I tend to approach problems, but it was interesting. Creating a simple computer game without a single line of code was a bit of a challenge, as I had to think in big picture steps rather than intricate details.</p>
