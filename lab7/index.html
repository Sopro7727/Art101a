					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a few issues when putting this assignment together. First, I couldn't figure out why the user input prompt was appearing multiple times whenever I reloaded the page, so I turned to the code-questions channel in the class discord and got some very helpful advice about where my error was. Second, I had to fiddle around with the .toLowerCase and .toUpperCase functions in order for them to work as intended. Then I had some issues with the syntax in my document.writeln for my js file, but that was due to me trying to write the output as a js string, rather than HTML text. Lastly, I had some issues with getting the formatting right for the anagramed Nametag, but that just took some time and effort. Overall, a lot of these problems were solved by brute force and determination. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was a lot of fun. It reminded me of the coding problems I used to have to do back in highschool, so there was an odd sense of nostalgia, even though I had never done anything like this with html. It was just the right amount of challenging, and I had to remind myself that asking for outside help is not a crime. So it was fun and mildly humbling. </p>
