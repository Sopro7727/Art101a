			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only real problem that I ran into was I wasn't happy with the first function we came up with, so I wanted to make something more complicated. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was really interesting. Anonymous functions are something I don't have a whole lot of practice with, as I usually just make named functions. It was also really convienent to use a callback function rather than manually doing all the iterations myself. Overall, very interesting and fun to do. </p>
